It performs every task that a LL-1 parser has to perform like it gets first and follow sets and then displays them. It also provides a Parse Table and a Stack to check whether the string you are entering is parsed successfully or not.
If parsed successfully then it displays Successfully parsed otherwise it says Parsing Failed.
